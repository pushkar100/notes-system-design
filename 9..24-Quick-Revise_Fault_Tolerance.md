# Quick Revision: Fault Tolerance

Definition: The ability of a system to continue operating properly (perhaps at a reduced level) in the event of the failure of some of its components

In a nutshell: "If engine A breaks, engine B keeps the plane flying."

## Fail Open vs Fail Closed

These are the _specific strategies_ you choose to achieve (or sacrifice) fault tolerance depending on the goal

- Fail Open (Allow/Pass): If the system crashes or times out, the request is allowed to proceed
  - Reliability Context: Prioritizes _Availability_ and _User Experience_
  - When to choose: When blocking a valid user is worse than letting a potentially bad one through
  - Example: A Rate Limiter for an Amazon checkout (better to risk a bot buying a toy than to block a real human with money)

- Fail Closed (Block/Deny): If the system crashes or times out, the request is rejected
  - Reliability Context: Prioritizes _Security_ and _Data Integrity_
  - When to choose: When unauthorized access is catastrophic
  - Example: An Authorization Service (if the system can't verify you are the admin, it must assume you are not)

**Summary Rule of Thumb**
- If losing money/users is the biggest risk, Fail Open
- If losing data/security is the biggest risk, Fail Closed
